  summary: `After graduating with my Bachelor's degree in 2022, I joined Zimmermann Editorial GmbH, an agency specialising in internal communications for clients such as DHL Group, secusmart and Deutsche Bank. Working across a variety of media, including print, newsletters, mobile reporting and environmental design, has allowed me to refine my skills in both traditional and digital communication design.\n\n Working on smaller web projects made me realise how much I enjoyed the creative, challenging and technical aspects of web development. Inspired by this, I fully immersed myself in a web development bootcamp, deepening my knowledge and transitioning into more dynamic, code-driven design solutions â€” combining these new skills with my extensive design expertise.`,
