    institution: 'WBS Coding School',
    period: '03.2025 - 07.2025',
    description: `I completed an intensive four-month bootcamp in modern full-stack web development, where I gained hands-on experience building responsive, user-friendly interfaces using technologies such as JavaScript and React. I worked on developing dynamic frontends that interact seamlessly with backend services and APIs. On the backend, I worked with Node.js and Express to build RESTful APIs and server-side logic. I also gained practical experience with both SQL and NoSQL databases, including PostgreSQL and MongoDB, for storing and managing application data. My training covered key backend concepts such as authentication, data modeling, and deployment.`,

    description: `I studied Graphic Design and Visual Communication, where I developed a strong interest in the relationship between design and technology. For my bachelor's thesis, I researched the increasing use of social media due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the potential consequences for people. As a solution to the problem of people's loneliness, I developed a concept for an app called Connect that rethinks the role of social media and encourages users to engage in offline activities, alone or with others, that suit them.`,
